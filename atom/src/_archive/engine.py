    """Runs the user's Python script in a subprocess and prints requested viz slices to stdout.

    On creation, the `_ExecutionManager` starts a new process and a new thread. The new process runs
    `execute.run_script()`, which in turn runs the user-written script within a `Pdb` instance. The
    ExecutionEngineMessages produced by any evaluated watch expressions are added to a queue. The thread reads this
    queue, printing any messages to stdout as they are added. Client programs, such as `repl.js`, can read these
    printed schemas.

    The thread is necessary to prevent blocking; otherwise, the engine would either have to block until script execution
    is done, preventing re-runs, or messages would only be output after the process completes, which would produce long
    delays in longer scripts. The subprocess cannot write to stdout itself, so the thread must do so instead.

    Once the user-written script has executed, `execute.run_script()` waits for the user to request the models of
    additional vizzes. Those requests are sent from the client to stdin, and then sent to the `_ExecutionManager`,
    which adds the request to a queue that is read by `execute.run_script()`.
